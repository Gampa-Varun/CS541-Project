# CS541-Project

This ReadMe will initially contain bunch of information and instructions necessary for the collaborators to 
a) Update the prject state
b) Instructions for basic environment setup and necessary 'fixes' outside the scope of the python code.


The CS541-Project repo contains the modules for an end-end transformer model for image caption generation. 
It used a SWIN transformer as it's backbone, followed by novel refining encoders and finally a decoder to generate image captions
It is based on the paper: 'End-to-End Transformer Based Model for Image Captioning' authored by Yiyu Wang, Jungang Xu, Yingfei Sun
